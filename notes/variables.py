# EL 2nd Variables Notes

# Syntax tells you how to set up your code. Syntax = grammar
# name=content
# The name is how we access the variable, no spaces are allowed, specific
# Variable names have to begin with a letter or underscore
# Variable names cannot contain special characters
# All variable names must be unique within the program
# The content is the value that the program uses
# Declaration - Making the variable exsist
# Initialization - put initial value in the variable aka the first thing you put in it

# first thing you put in the variable
# How do you reset a variable? Just rewrite it?
# How do you print variables? print(variable name)
# Why are variables important in programming?
# What are the 3 naming systems used in programming?
# Why can't we have spaces when we name things in python?
